# Interactive class diagram
SET-seminar 2020-2021, visualization of K9 Mail application

Visualization of the role-stereotypes and dependencies of the K9 Mail application.

## Usage

Open main.html with your favorite browser. Use the role toggles in the sidebar to show/hide classes and dependencies to classes with the role. Click on a package to collapse/expand it. When dependencies are aggregated, use the dependecie threshold slider to only show dependencie lines that represent at least that amount of dependencies.
